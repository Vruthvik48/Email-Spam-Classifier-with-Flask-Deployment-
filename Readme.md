# üìß Email Spam Classifier

A machine learning-based Email Spam Classifier that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify emails as **spam** or **not spam (ham)**. This project demonstrates an end-to-end ML pipeline including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

---

## üß† Project Overview

This project includes:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing using NLP techniques  
- Feature extraction using techniques like **TF-IDF**  
- Model training using algorithms such as **Naive Bayes**  
- Model evaluation and accuracy testing  
- Building a **Flask** web app for live email spam prediction

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **Python**  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**  
- **Scikit-learn**  
- **NLTK**  
- **Flask**  
- **HTML/CSS** (for the web interface)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This project is intended for educational purposes only.
Accuracy may vary depending on preprocessing techniques and dataset quality.

Gmail and other modern email providers already have advanced spam filters.
This project is not meant to replace them, but to demonstrate how machine learning can be used for spam detection.
